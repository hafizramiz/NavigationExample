## Navigation Example with Jetpack Compose
This repository serves as a concise guide on implementing navigation in Jetpack Compose using the Navigation component. The provided code demonstrates how to set up navigation between screens, handle arguments, and leverage the power of sealed classes for defining routes.

## Usage
1. Add the Navigation Compose dependency to your build.gradle:
implementation("androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.7.5")
2. Create a NavHost, define a NavGraph, and use the NavController to navigate between screens.

` @Composable
fun Navigation() {
    // ...
    // Define your screens and navigation logic here.
    // ...
}
`
